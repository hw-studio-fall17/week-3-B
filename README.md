# CSS: Let's style our site
###### REMEMBER! When you are stuck...GOOGLE IS YOUR FRIEND. "HOW TO ____________ using CSS"

## Level One
![level one](/images/level-1.png)
* Make the background color of the `body` a nice green. I used `#518248`
* Change the `font-family` of the body. See some options here: [CSS font families](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp)
* Center the "Climb Every Mountain" heading.
* Change the background color of the `quote-box` to white.
* Make the width of the `quote-box` shorter.
* Figure out how to round the corners of the `quote-box`. Hint: Google "how to round corners in CSS"
* Add `10px` of `padding` to the `quote-box` .


## Level Two
![level two](/images/level-2.png)
* Change the `body` to have a `linear-gradient()` background color. Check out this [link](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_gradients.asp) for help. **HINT**: Notice that `linear-gradient()` is used on `background` not `background-color`.
* If you are having trouble getting the gradient to go across the whole page. Try adding `background-attachment: fixed;`
* Make all of the `author`s a smaller font size.
* Put a border around the `built-strong-box` .
* Change the color of the text inside to white.
* Center the text.
* Make the width shorter.
* Use the CSS `float` property to move this box to the right. Hint: Google CSS float property


## Level Three
![level three](/images/level-3.png)
* Change the `background` from a `linear-gradient` to be the mountain image that is in your `images` folder. Check out this [link](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/how-do-i-add-a-background-image-in-the-css-file) for help. HINT: You are not using a link so you will be accessing the image with something like `url(images/example.jpg)`.
* Can you only see the clouds in your background image?? Resize the image to fit the page. HINT: the answer is on the same [link](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/how-do-i-add-a-background-image-in-the-css-file) from above.
* Increase the `font-size` of your heading.

## Level Four
![level four](/images/level-4.png)
* Go to [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1001467%20%7C%20Material.IO%20%7C%20Global%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Hybrid%20%7C%20Text%20%7C%20BKWS&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=Cj0KCQjwgb3OBRDNARIsAOyZbxDFzRNeAbqeZKb-lU-ICkiGG15qYxhSW_qbi73u_30XYS5BaMrNhmIaAuIzEALw_wcB)
* Search for the font `Monoton`.
* Click the red + button.
* Click on the `1 Family Selected` pop up at the bottom
* Like the direction on the pop up say, add the `<link>` to you index.html inside the `<head>` at the top
* Use the CSS `font-family` directions given on the website change the font of the heading to `Monoton`.
* Set the width of each `quote` to `25%` of the `quote-box`
* Try to figure out how to get the `<li>` side by side. HINT: check out this [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9189810/css-display-inline-vs-inline-block)
* Once you get the `<li>` side by side use `border-left` to create a line inbetween each quote.
* Add some `padding` so that there is some space inbetween the border and words
* Make the quotes italicized
